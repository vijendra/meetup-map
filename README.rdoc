= Meetup Mapper
{<img src="https://codeclimate.com/badge.png" />}[https://codeclimate.com/github/vijendra/meetup-map]
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Ruby on Rails application that makes it easy to visualize
meetup groups for a particular topic. We're starting off by
visualizing the meetup groups associated with Quantifed Self
(http://quantifiedself.com). The goal is for people to be able to
quickly find the meetup gruop close to them, and eventually to browse
upcoming events and past resources.

Demo: http://meetup-map.herokuapp.com

To initialize the group information:
- rake data:scrape_meetup_groups
- rake data:update_groups_with_api_data
